GStreamer-MSDK
==============
GStreamer plugins for Intel&reg; Media SDK


Overview
--------
GStreamer-MSDK consists of a collection of GStreamer plugins for Intel&reg; Media SDK (MSDK).
This allows users to use MSDK in their GStreamer-based applications with minimal knowledge of 
the MSDK API.

GStreamer-MSDK includes plugins to perform decode, encode, video postprocessing (VPP)
and high performance rendering. Please refer to README.USAGE for more information about these
plugins and their usage.


Features
--------
 - Decode H264 AVC, MPEG-2, JPEG, VC-1, HEVC, VP8 and VP9 videos
 - Compatible with GStreamer-based video players such as Totem, Parole and gst-play
   through playbin element.
 - Support for zero-copy rendering with glimagesink using EGL
 - Support rendering using Wayland renderer
 - Support rendering using X11 renderer with DRI3 backend
 - Support X11 / Wayland rendering using EGL renderer
 - Support VPP acceleration of dynamic procamp control during video playback
 - Support for subtitles (text overlay) via MFX VPP surface composition
 - Support all Media SDK postprocessing capabilities as exposed by the MSDK API
 - Encode / transcode video into H.264, HEVC, MPEG-2 and JPEG formats


Requirements
------------

**Software requirements**

  * Media Server Studio 2016 Community / Professional Edition (Haswell / Broadwell)  
    Media Server Studio 2017 Community / Professional Edition (Broadwell / Skylake)  
    Media SDK 2017 for Yocto Embedded Edition (Apollo Lake)
  * GStreamer 1.6.x (tested up to GStreamer 1.10.x)
  * gst-plugins-* 1.6.x (tested up to GStreamer 1.10.x)
  * CMake
 
  * Renderers:  
    Wayland (>=1.7)  
    X11 (DRI 3)  
    EGL

**Hardware requirements**

  * Intel Haswell / Broadwell / Skylake with Intel HD / Iris Pro graphics
  * Intel Apollo Lake


Compiling
---------
GStreamer-MSDK uses the CMake build tool to build the plugins.
Create a build folder within the source directory and run the CMake
command to configure the out-of-source build.

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..

To make a debug build:

	cmake .. -DDEBUG=ON
		
To build the plugins for Media Server Studio 2016 Linux Edition:

	cmake .. -DWITH_MSS_2016=ON

Only Media SDK 2017 Embedded Edition supports VP9 decode for now. To enable VP9 decode support:

	cmake .. -DUSE_VP9_DECODER=ON

For a list of more options when configuring the build, refer to the CMakeLists.txt file inside the source directory.

Next step is to compile and install the GStreamer-MSDK plugins:

	make
	make install

To uninstall the plugins:

	make uninstall

If you intend to rebuild the plugins after making changes to the source code or you would
want to change some of the build options after uninstalling the plugins, it is highly recommended to
simply delete the build folder that you have created and repeat the build process as above.


Usage
-----
Please refer to README.USAGE for examples on how to accomplish various
video-related tasks with the GStreamer-MSDK plugins.


TODO
----
 - Microsoft&reg; Visual Studio support for Windows 10 enablement


License
-------
GStreamer-MSDK libraries and plugins are available under the
terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1+.
