  GStreamer-MSDK
  Media SDK plugins for GStreamer

Overview
--------

GStreamer-MSDK consists of a collection of Media SDK-based plugins for
GStreamer.

  * `mfxdecode' is used to decode H.264 AVC, MPEG-2, HEVC, VC-1 and
    JPEG videos using the underlying hardware capabilities. 

  * `mfxsink' is used to render the decoded frame to a Wayland / X11
    display.
  

Features
--------

  * Decode H264 AVC, MPEG-2, JPEG, VC-1 and HEVC Videos
  * Support for the Wayland display server
  * Support for headless decode pipelines


Requirements
------------

Software requirements

  * Media SDK 2016 R1 for Yocto Embedded (MediaSDK2016R1forYoctoEmbedded-Alpha2.tar.gz) or
    Media Server Studio 2016 Professional R1 (Haswell)
  * GStreamer 1.4.x (up to including GStreamer 1.6):
  * GStreamer-Plugins-Base 1.4.x (up to including GStreamer 1.6):
  * CMake
  
  * Renderers:
      Wayland (>=1.7)
      X11 (With EGL backend)
      EGL

Hardware requirements

  * Intel Apollo Lake
  * Intel Braswell
  * Intel Haswell / Broadwell

Compiling
---------

GStreamer-MSDK uses the CMake build tool to build the plugins.
Create a build directory within the source directory and run the CMake
command to configure the build.

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	
Next step is to compile the GStreamer-MSDK plugins:

	make

To install the plugins:

        make install

The plugins will be installed in the /usr/lib64/gstreamer-1.0 directory.

Usage
-----

  * Play an H.264 video with an MP4 container
  $ gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=/path/to/video.mp4 ! \
      qtdemux ! h264parse ! mfxdecode ! mfxsink

Known Issues
-----------

  * Decode for VC-1 Advance Profile bitstream is not working.
  * EGL-based renderer for X11 / Wayland does not work with the Intel UFO driver,
    only the MESA  OTC driver. Hence, EGL options are turned off in the default
    cmake configuration. You may turn on those options during the cmake configuration
    to enable the EGL renderer.
